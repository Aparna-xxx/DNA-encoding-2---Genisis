-From the Book of Genesis The following text is used 
-“Let man have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.”
-This text is converted to ITU morse code and then converted to Nucleotide sequences
-The Morse code is translated to nucleotides as follows:
  -Dash → T 
  -Dot → C 
  -Space (Word) → A 
  -Space (Letter) → G
-Information Density refers to the amount of data (in bits) which can be stored in a given length of DNA (considering both actual and payload data)
-Information Density (in bits per nucleotide) = (Number of Symbols * Bits per symbol)/ total number of nucleotides
